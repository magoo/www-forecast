<p>The estimate feature solicits the knowledge of others to narrow down the range of numbers a <i>true</i> value is believed lie within.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How many coins are in a jar?</li>
  <li>How much money earned in sales next month?</li>
  <li>How often will a new piece of hardware fail?</li>
</ul>

<p>Panelists will submit their <i>minimum</i> and <i>maximum</i> values, creating a range of values they believe the answer to lie within.</p>

<p>Panelists are expected to be <i>calibrated</i> and <i>trained</i> to guess with 90% certainty.</p>
