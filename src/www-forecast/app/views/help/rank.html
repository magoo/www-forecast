<p>The rank feature solicits the knowledge of others to arrange options based on preference.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Who would make our best leader?</li>
  <li>Where is the most preferable location for our headquarters?</li>
  <li>What tasks would mitigate the most risk?</li>
</ul>

<p>Panelists will submit <i>sorts</i>, which will give insight into the groups preferences between their options.</p>

<p>Panelists are expected to be <i>calibrated</i> and <i>trained</i> to think probabilistically.</p>
