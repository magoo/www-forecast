<p>The scenario feature solicits the knowledge of others to discover certainty associated with future outcomes.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Will it rain or shine tomorrow between 3pm-5pm?</li>
  <li>Will an event happen several times, or not at all?</li>
  <li>Will a certain candidate win an election?</li>
  <li>Will a disaster take place?</li>
</ul>

<p>Panelists will submit <i>probabilities</i>, which will give insight into the groups certainty about the future.</p>

<p>Panelists are expected to be <i>calibrated</i> and <i>trained</i> to think probabilistically.</p>
